# ffmpeg-player
> Play video using ffmpeg.


## External Program

This package uses these following programs, make sure these program are added
to your path.

* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
* [ffplay](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - Bundle with `ffmpeg`.


## Capability

Base on `ffplay`'s website.

> ffplay is a very simple and portable media player using the FFmpeg libraries
and the SDL library. It is mostly used as a testbed for the various FFmpeg APIs.

Hence, I have encounter some issues synchronize video and audio. Try move the
timeline by pressing `<left>` or `<right>` key multiple times could resolve 
such a issue.


## Usage

You can play the video by calling function `ffmpeg-player-video`.

```el
(ffmpeg-player-video (expand-file-name "./test/1.avi"))
```


## Todo List

- [] Play youtube video through url.
