## üìù Acknowledge

This package will output video into images (in frame). This might causes
many I/O times and disk space (Even though these frames will eventually get 
cleaned up). I would like to mention you all the information and consequences
before you use this package.

*See [melpa/6560](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/6560) for more information.*

## External Program

This package uses these following programs, make sure these program are added
to your path.

* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
* [ffplay](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - Bundle with `ffmpeg`.

## üîå Capability

Base on `ffplay`'s website.

> ffplay is a very simple and portable media player using the FFmpeg libraries
and the SDL library. It is mostly used as a testbed for the various FFmpeg APIs.

Hence, I have encounter some issues synchronize video and audio. Try move the
timeline by pressing `<left>` or `<right>` key multiple times could resolve
such an issue.

## üîß Usage

You can play the video by calling function `ffmpeg-player-video`.

```el
(ffmpeg-player-video (expand-file-name "./test/1.avi"))
```

And here is the control of the media.

* <kbd>space</kbd> - Pause/Unpause.
* <kbd>up</kbd> - Increase volume by 5.
* <kbd>down</kbd> - Decrease volume by 5.
* <kbd>left</kbd> - Backward timeline 10 seconds.
* <kbd>right</kbd> - Forward timeline 10 seconds.
* <kbd>m</kbd> - Mute/Unmute.
* <kbd>r</kbd> - Replay.

## üìù Todo List

- [ ] Play youtube video through url.
